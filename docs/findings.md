# Findings

Dated entries. Every figure carries the command that produced it. Predictions are recorded before
the run that tests them and are never edited afterwards; outcomes are appended below them.

## 2026-10-01 — predictions (spec §8.5), recorded before any model runs

1. For a single new case, SU2 beats the PINN on cost by one to two orders of magnitude.
2. The FNO beats "just run SU2" only after roughly as many new cases as it took to train it
   (about a thousand), unless the data-efficiency curve shows far fewer training cases suffice.
3. Without the Kutta condition, the PINN's residuals look acceptable while its lift is wrong.

## 2026-10-01 — environment

- Apple GPU (MPS) available in the author's terminal: True (measured by the controller's shell,
  torch 2.13.0, `torch.backends.mps.is_available()`).
- Measured while planning (from the spike in ~/theLab/bwb-tanker-study/cache/su2_spike):
  the far-point-at-same-angle O-grid folds (9,792 inverted cells at t = 0.08, m = 0.04);
  vertex-lumped force integration reproduces SU2's CL/CD/CMz to 5e-11.

## 2026-10-01 — final review fix wave: measurements and decisions

- **Shock locator (spec 8.2 amended).** The steepest-rise rule found the trailing-edge
  recompression on every real supercritical solution. On S0 attempt 2's restarts
  (`runs/s0_attempt2_eps1e-8`), `shocks()` before the fix: super-mg0 upper x/c = 0.99851 / 0.99993
  / 0.99991 at 128x49 / 256x97 / 512x193 with Mach 0.47 / 0.41 / 0.42 ahead; anchor both surfaces at
  0.9997-0.99998. After restricting the search to supersonic-upstream segments: super upper
  0.681 / 0.675 / 0.678 (Mach ahead 1.13 / 1.22 / 1.21); anchor upper 0.633 / 0.627 / 0.630 and
  lower 0.343 / 0.349 / 0.352. Command, per (name, M, alpha, t, m, level):
  `python -c "from apno.geometry.ogrid import *; from apno.su2.restart import *; from apno.physics.flow import *; from apno.score.metrics import shocks; X,Y=grid(Section(0.12,0.02),TRAIN); f=on_grid(read_restart('runs/s0_attempt2_eps1e-8/256x97/super-mg0/restart.dat'),X,Y); q=nondimensionalise(f['Density'],f['Momentum_x'],f['Momentum_y'],f['Energy'],0.75); print(shocks(X[:,0],pressure_coefficient(q[3][:,0],0.75),0.75))"`
- **FNO device (spec 6.4).** Training defaults to the Apple GPU when MPS is available. FNO2d at the
  spec sizes, batch 8 at 128x49, one AdamW step: CPU 0.19 s, MPS 0.058 s (command:
  `python -c "import torch,time; from apno.models.fno import FNO2d; d='mps'; m=FNO2d().to(d); x=torch.randn(8,6,128,49,device=d); o=torch.optim.AdamW(m.parameters()); [(o.zero_grad(),m(x).square().mean().backward(),o.step()) for _ in range(2)]; torch.mps.synchronize(); t=time.perf_counter(); [(o.zero_grad(),m(x).square().mean().backward(),o.step()) for _ in range(3)]; torch.mps.synchronize(); print((time.perf_counter()-t)/3)"`,
  `d='cpu'` and no synchronize for the CPU). `process_time()` cannot see GPU work, so S4 costs
  GPU training at WALL time and CPU training at CPU time; `costs.json` records the basis per method.
- **PINN cost (spec 7.5's estimate does not hold for the viscous runs).** The viscous flux is now
  folded into the conservative divergence (same operator, one derivative pass). Measured on
  test_in-0000 at the spec sizes (20,000 points, 7x96 tanh), wall seconds:
  Euler 0.31 per Adam step and 0.76 per float64 closure (3.6 h projected per run), visc1e-3 2.12
  and 7.26 (27.8 h), gradnorm 0.35 and 0.64 plus 0.45 per balancing update (3.8 h). Command:
  `python -c "from apno.data.sampling import case_specs; from apno.geometry.ogrid import TRAIN, Section; from apno.models.pinn import PinnCase; from apno.models.train_pinn import *; s=case_specs('test_in',TRAIN)[0]; c=PinnCase(s.mach,s.alpha_deg,Section(s.t,s.m)); cfg=PinnConfig(viscosity=1e-3); r=time_steps(c,cfg,2,1); print(r, projected_s(cfg,r)/3600)"`.
  `scripts/s3_pinn.py` now times every planned variant first, writes `results/s3/preflight.json`
  and refuses to start past `--budget-hours` (default 48). With two to four viscous runs the
  projection is about 90-140 h, so S3 needs a recorded decision (fewer points, steps or viscous
  runs, or a larger budget) before it launches.
- **Gradient-norm balancing (spec 7.5's variant)** is implemented as
  `PinnConfig(grad_balance=True)` and S3 plans one such run, on the median-Mach showcase case.

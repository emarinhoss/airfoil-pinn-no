# Findings

Dated entries. Every figure carries the command that produced it. Predictions are recorded before
the run that tests them and are never edited afterwards; outcomes are appended below them.

## 2026-10-01 — predictions (spec §8.5), recorded before any model runs

1. For a single new case, SU2 beats the PINN on cost by one to two orders of magnitude.
2. The FNO beats "just run SU2" only after roughly as many new cases as it took to train it
   (about a thousand), unless the data-efficiency curve shows far fewer training cases suffice.
3. Without the Kutta condition, the PINN's residuals look acceptable while its lift is wrong.

## 2026-10-01 — environment

- Apple GPU (MPS) available in the author's terminal: True (measured by the controller's shell,
  torch 2.13.0, `torch.backends.mps.is_available()`).
- Measured while planning (from the spike in ~/theLab/bwb-tanker-study/cache/su2_spike):
  the far-point-at-same-angle O-grid folds (9,792 inverted cells at t = 0.08, m = 0.04);
  vertex-lumped force integration reproduces SU2's CL/CD/CMz to 5e-11.
